After doing Masters from IISc, Ravindra went on to work for Cisco Systems as a senior software engineer. He later left Cisco Systems for the passion he has for teaching. His core value is to change lives of millions using technology. He strongly believes that the industrial age idea " Go to school and get a job" is highly irrelevant and absurd in this information age.

He conducts trainings and workshops for employees of various software companies and for the students of various colleges on the cutting edge technologies and latest developments in the area of cloud computing.
